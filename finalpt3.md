# COMPELLING TITLE

Budget Visualizations

## Visualization 1: Bar chart - budget vs departments

x-axis has three bars to represent revised budget, budget remaining, actual balance, y-axis has the bars grouped into departments - you can click on the bars to turn them a different color

## Visualization 2: Line chart - budget changes over the years

multiple lines with a legend and different colors to represent changes in budget over the years (for datasets)

## Visualizations Beyond: Use contextual datasets to produce some other visualizations we can compare to (need two of these)
